# Dog-Breed-Classifier
Welcome to the world of dog breed classification! In this project, we have developed a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately identify the breed of a dog from an input image. As dog lovers, we understand the importance of correctly identifying the breed of a furry friend, whether it's for a pet owner who is curious about their dog's heritage or for a veterinarian who needs to determine the appropriate medical care. Our CNN model has been trained on a large dataset of diverse dog images, allowing it to learn intricate features and patterns that are unique to different dog breeds. Through meticulous training and fine-tuning, our model has achieved impressive accuracy in breed prediction. Join us on this exciting journey as we unveil the capabilities of our dog breed classifier model and showcase its potential applications in the field of computer vision and animal science.

## About the Project
I used an image classification application with a deep learning model called a convolutional neural network (CNN) for this task. I utilized three different CNN architectures, namely AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet, which had already been trained on a large dataset of 1.2 million images called ImageNet. I used a pre-built classifier function in the classifier.py file, which allowed me to classify my images. The test_classifier.py file contained an example program that demonstrated how to use the classifier function. My goal was to explore and compare these three architectures to determine which one was best suited for my image classification application.

It's important to note that some dog breeds looked very similar to each other, and the performance of the algorithm in distinguishing between these similar-looking breeds depended on the number of training images available for each breed. For example, breeds like Great Pyrenees and Kuvasz, German Shepherd and Malinois, Beagle and Walker Hound, among others, had similar appearances.

## How to run
  * Install all the dependencies
  * Upload the dog images into "uploaded_images" folder. 
  * Run the batch file, if needed change the CNN architechture. 
  * You should get the output picture wise.
